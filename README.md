Ahmed Fatah
I’m Ahmed, and I’m just starting my journey into software development. My background is in civil engineering, but I’ve always been drawn to building things in a way that goes beyond the physical world. That curiosity led me to programming, where I’m now learning how to develop mobile applications and create games from scratch.

Right now, as a start, I’m focused on learning Android development with Kotlin and React Native, while also exploring game development with Unity and C#. I’m also interested in prompt engineering and how AI can help improve coding and creativity.

I still have a long way to go, and there’s so much more to learn, but I’m excited about the process. Every challenge is a step forward, and I believe that consistent effort leads to real progress.

What I’m Working On
Learning the fundamentals of mobile app development and building small projects
Exploring Unity and C# to understand game mechanics and interaction
Experimenting with AI tools to improve problem-solving and development speed
I’d love to connect with others in tech, whether you’re just starting out like me or have experience to share. Learning from different perspectives and gaining new experiences is what makes this journey exciting.
